# Advance TV Beta
V.0.25
Open source scripts for the roku channel
Advance TV is a combination of channels on Roku that streams free live TV. I dont own any of the streams since it is all open source. The m3u8 for the streams are all hosted on this github account and is in my tv respitory. I will publish channels for a specific catergorie with a limit of 10 streams. In later versions The app will be in one and not for ex: Advance TV news and Advance TV education, It will just be Advance TV.
